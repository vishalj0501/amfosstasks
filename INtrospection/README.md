INTROSPECTION

*Why we must choose you?

I am a rookie in coding(started learning, and I'm enjoying it),But what made me choose AI is curiosity and intention to build something new,something which hasn't been found yet.I want to keep learning and growing in this field to find my potential and contribute to various sectors which can improve the human standards of living.I think amfoss will guide me ,hence helping me explore and learn more about my passion.Therefore I feel that seeing this passion of mine Amfoss should choose  me to be a part this club. :)

*What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Since I've just begun my journey,my current goal is to learn,learn and learn. I want to explore AI and potential of this field. Since AI is being used in different fields these days,a lot has been developed in this field and lot is yet to come up.Only if I learn, explore, and keep myself updated I will get to know what is yet to be developed/made and hence I can channelise my direction.If I get selected to be a part of amfoss,then this process can be accelerated.   So,primarily my goal is to focus on learning.

*How would you contribute back to the club?

I will try to work to the extent of my limits to do what the club wants from me.I would give my best to achieve something in future which amfoss could boast of.


*Do you have any feedback for the selection process?


No,The selection process is very good.There is a lot to learn by just completing the tasks.
