I could write the Java code for the First two Questions.[Euler 2 qns.zip](https://github.com/vishalj0501/amfosstasks/files/7572962/Euler.2.qns.zip)


I could get the idea for the 3rd question..but could not implement it into a code.

4th and 5th Qn could not find ways to solve.
WIll try those left over questions before November 2021.
Since Java is the first programming language I started to learn ...
I'm planning to increase my practise hours per day For java...
So I'll try finishing Qn3, Qn4, and Qn5  in the process..   :)
