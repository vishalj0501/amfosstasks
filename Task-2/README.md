mkdir North                  (create a directory north)

cd North                     (change directory to north)

touch NDegree.txt            (create a file called NDegree.txt in North folder)

echo 9>>Ndegree.txt          (write the data to NDegree file)

cat NDegree.txt NMinutes.txt NSeconds.txt >NorthCoordinates.txt  (To create a file from combination of other three files)

cp NorthCoordinates.txt /home/Desktop/Coordinate-Locations        (To copy the txt to a directory)

cd..                                    (To go back to the old directory)
